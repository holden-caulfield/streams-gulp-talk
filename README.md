=================

I just came here for the reference links!
-----------------------------------------

Here you are:

* [Stream Handbook](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook): Nice explanation of streams and links to lots of nice libraries to do basically anything with streams
* [How streams help to raise node.js performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgEuZ52OZtU): If you prefer a video explanation and want something better that my talk ;P
* [Why you shouldnâ€™t create a gulp plugin](http://blog.overzealous.com/post/74121048393/why-you-shouldnt-create-a-gulp-plugin-or-how-to-stop): A nice explanation from a guy that went on a similar journey than mine, to understand gulp's point of view
